# Arbitrary-Precision-Calculator
An Arbitrary Precision Calculator implemented using Data Structures to perform arithmetic on very large numbers beyond built-in data type limits. Numbers are stored digit-by-digit using linked lists, and operations like addition, subtraction, and multiplication are performed manually with proper carry and borrow handling.
